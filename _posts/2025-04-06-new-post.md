1. **What did you think of Paper 11. More on getters and setters and what would make it better?**
   - I thought that the paper was actually really interesting! I hadn't ever really thought about making an object
     that gets data for you to better encapsulate code. I feel like this can be useful in a lot of contexts.
     For example, as my group was building the website for the IDB project, I realized that we were assuming the way
     the data in the backend was stored/implemented when we were calling the data from the frontend. I now
     wonder if, to make it cleaner, there's a way we can use the principle used in the paper to make an object
     in the backend that can help us interact with the UI/frontend better.
2. **Did you get help or give help on Exercise #11: SQL Join or the quizzes? If so, how?**
   - I definitely got a lot of help on Exercise #11 from my friend. I thought it was pretty difficult to do it
     in the time frame given, especially since I feel like we haven't had much hands-on practice with SQL
     other than the few exercises we've had recently. My friend helped me get a lot of the notation right
     and helped me approach the problems correctly.
3. **What did you think of the following topics, and what would make them better?: SQL, set union, set intersection, set difference, left join, right join, Java, final classes, static methods.**
  - I thought that all of these topics were taught pretty well in class. I think this unit about SQL has been a lot easier to digest than the previous units with Python.
    I just wish instead of watching Professor Downing type and ask questions, we could type/test along with him, because it's hard for me to passively learn SQL
    without actively doing it. Although we do have the exercises, I wish there were more opportunities like this that were un-timed and stress-free so we can actually
    get more out of it.
