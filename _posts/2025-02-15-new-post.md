1. **What did you think of Paper 5. The Single Responsibility Principle and what would make it better?**
   - I liked how the paper was short and concise, with lots of real-life examples. To make it better, I would suggest the authors
     to make it more clear what the definition and scope of a 'responsiblity' is. On one of the class comments, I thought it was
     interesting that someone mentioned that they were confused on what would exactly be considered a 'responsibility' worth
     separating. Wouldn't there be infinite responsibilities we can think of to separate a class? The paper discusses how a
     responsibility is worth separating, then, when there's a failure in the code. But is this really efficient? Shouldn't we
     also separate if we expect failure? In that case, how should we define that expectation?
2. **Did you get help or give help on Exercise #4: range or the quizzes? If so, how?**
   - I got lots of help from the TAs on Exercise #4. I was really confused at first how things were structured and had to
     clarify that start and stop defined indices. Though I didn't get the full points on this exercise, it was interesting
     to see how the range class could be implemented and helped me understand the context of what we were learning in class. 
3. **What did you think of the following topics (range, types, count(), zip(), yield), and what would make them better?**
   - I think the topics are interesting but am having a hard time feeling engaged in class recently. Right now, it feels like
     the class is mainly covering Python syntax, when I want to also understand how these tools can be applied in software development.
     I think the discussion on yield got close to this, because it was cool to see how it can be used in our code and is a
     very helpful tool, but overall, I wish there was more of an emphasis on the applications of all these topics. 
4. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
   - My tip of the week is to take care of yourself :) I feel like this is one of our busiest times of the semester, so it's
     easy to start sacrificing sleep and regular meals, but it's important to make sure we all remember that our health always
     comes first. Happy Valentine's Day yall!
