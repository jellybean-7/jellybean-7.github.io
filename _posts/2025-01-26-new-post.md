1. **Did you help your classmates with either the quizzes or the exercises? If so, how?**
Yes, I helped my classmates with both the quizzes and exercises. For example, for one of the quizzes this week, I remembered the difference between floor and true division and helped the people around me remember it from class. For the exercise, I also helped my friend remember that 1 isn't a prime number when we were stuck on that test case. 

2. **What did you think of Paper #2: Makefile and what would make it better?**
I thought that the Makefile was good and comprehensive, but it was hard for me to understand since I didn't have much experience with Makefiles. However, I really liked how we could annotate it because after reading my classmates' comments, I was able to better understand each line. I think the only thing that could make it better is describing the purpose of the comments in the Makefile - for example, the very first line of the Makefile is a comment that looks like a path, but a lot of my classmates (based on the annotations) weren't sure why it was there.

4. **What did you think of the assertions, unit tests, coverage, exceptions, and what would make it better?**
I really liked the lecture about these topics. I thought it was very beginner-friendly, and the differences between all four topics were very clear. I also loved learning about coverage - it's such a cool tool that I wish I had known about earlier so I could have made sure my test cases on my previous projects were as comprehensive as possible. I also really liked how Professor Downing made the distinction between assertions and exceptions because, originally, I thought they could be interchangeable. One thing that could make the lecture better is to cold-call people after introducing/explaining the topics instead of before. For example, instead of asking students what another application of assertions is, we can explain the different applications first and then ask students their advantages/disadvantages. I suggest this only because sometimes when people don't know the topics beforehand, it feels unproductive to sit and wait for an explanation. I feel like this could help free up some time that could be spent looking at more examples of these topics in real-world contexts/software projects. 

5. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
My pick-of-the-week is OpenAI's Operator tool. It has just become available in the U.S. to users with ChatGPT Pro. According to an online article, the Operator tool can access the web, fill out forms, make orders, etc.
