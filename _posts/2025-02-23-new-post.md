1. **What did you think of Paper 6. The Open-Closed Principle and what would make it better?**
   - I thought that the paper was interesting and concise. A lot of it felt like a review of data structures, and I liked
     how the paper explained concepts through examples. To improve it, the only thing I suggest is offering more real-life
     applications. For example, it would be cool to mention case studies from specific companies that demonstrate
     how important this principle is.
2. **Did you get help or give help on the quizzes? If so, how?**
   - I received help on the quizzes because I personally thought they were challenging this week. For example, on Monday's quiz,
     my friend and I accidentally flipped our logic at first on all the questions (for the behavior of printing a list of a
     function with yield or an instance of a function with yield), and I was only able to change my answers because she
     explained this to me.
3. **What did you think of the following topics: comprehensions, callables, functions, decorators and what would make them better?**
   - I thought that comprehensions, functions, and decorators were explained well, but I had trouble understanding
     callables at first. For some reason, I didn't realize that adding a __call__ function automatically made a class callable
     until Friday. I could have missed it accidentally, but to make it better, I think it would be nice if it were made more
     explicit. I also wish we got more context on why we are learning the things we are learning, because sometimes, just learning
     these syntax and techniques in Python without understanding how it applies to SWE makes it hard to feel engaged in the class.
4. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
   - My tip-of-the-week is to sleep!! It is recommended to get 7-8 hrs a day for men, and 9-10 hrs for women. This is a really busy
     week for all of us, and it's super important to make sure we give our body the rest and care it needs to succeed.
