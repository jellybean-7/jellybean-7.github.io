1. **Where did you grow up?**
   - I was born in Wisconsin, USA, but grew up mainly in Katy, TX, which is a suburb near Houston. 

2. **What high school did you attend?**
   - I attended Cinco Ranch High School in Katy, TX. 

3. **What was your favorite extracurricular activity in high school?**
   - My favorite extracurricular activity was Science Olympiad. I helped build our team from scratch and absolutely loved the competitions and the lifelong friends I made in that club.

4. **Where would you have gone if UT hadn't accepted you?**
   - If UT hadn't accepted me, I would have gone to Rice University. 

5. **What would you have majored in if CS hadn't accepted you?**
   - I would have majored in Aerospace Engineering if UTCS hadn't accepted me. I really enjoyed my physics classes in high school and thought that aerospace was an exciting field with lots of potential and unanswered questions I would have also loved  to explore. 

6. **Why are you in this class?**
   - I chose to take SWE because I wanted to learn software/web development before my first internship this summer with Dell Technologies and apply the skills I learn here to my startup, STEMkidz. I built a website last year for STEMkidz from scratch, but I still had some gaps in my understanding of software development and wasn't able to fully explore tools like SQL, which I know will help me expand my website.

7. **What are your expectations of this class?**
   - I expect this class to be rigorous but fun. I really enjoy these topics and am excited to finally gain a deeper understanding of software development.

8. **How much do you know about Javascript/Python/SQL/Web programming?**
   - I am familiar with Javascript, Python, and Web programming since I coded my startup's website from scratch last year. However, I don't have any experience with SQL, since I have been only using tools like MongoDB to store data.

9. **How did you like the first lectures?**
   - I liked the first lectures because they were engaging, and Professor Downing did a great job explaining thoroughly his expectations of the software development process for our first project. 

10. **How did you feel about the cold calling?**
    - I think cold calling is a great way to keep the class engaged and also quickly clear up any misunderstandings.

11. **What do you think about specifications grading?**
    - I think the specifications is a great way to keep the class holistic - it reminds me of the grading scale we used for Operating Systems (OS).

12. **What made you happy this week?**
    - I TOOK MY MCAT!! I'm also a pre-medical student and have been studying for the MCAT for 6 months. I finally took it on Thursday and feel great to finally start a new chapter of my life. 

13. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
    - My tip-of-the-week is to not procrastinate on our assignments and projects since there are a lot of moving parts in this class.
