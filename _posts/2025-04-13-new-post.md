1. **What did you think of Paper 12. Why extends is evil and what would make it better?**
   - I really enjoyed this paper! Compared to previous ones, this one felt more readable and was very concise. I also
     appreciated how they walked us through many examples as they explained the downfalls of classes/extends.
     It made me realize why I personally like coding in Python much more than Java - because Java requires classes,
     sometimes I feel like it's restricting. It was interesting to learn that Gosling, the founder of Java, felt that way, too.
     To improve the paper, maybe it would be cool for the author to compare Java to other
     programming languages like Python. 
2. **Did you get help or give help on Exercise #12: Singleton, Exercise #13: Observer or the quizzes? If so, how?**
   - I did get help from my friend for the exercise since I realized I forgot a lot of Java and struggled a bit. I also
     misunderstood how the run() function was used, so when I initially came up with a solution, it was printing the addresses
     of "Python", "Pylint", and "MyPy" instead of the actual words. For the quizzes, I gave help,
     since I had missed one of the classes before and thoroughly reviewed the lecture right before class. 
3. **What did you think of the following topics, and what would make them better?: Shapes, virtual function table, override, abstract methods, abstract classes, static methods.**
  - I thought that these topics were all taught well in class. I am really enjoying this material much more than the Python we
    covered earlier this semester. For example, I was never fully sure about the difference between static and dynamic methods
    until we covered it in class. To make them better, I think it would be cool if we could compare the advantages/disadvantages between
    Java and Python, especially since we learned about Python extensively at the start of the semester. I think it would also
    be useful to learn more real-life applications of these principles in software engineering. Right now, it just feels like
    Data Structures, but more in depth.
