1. **What did you think of Paper #4. All I Really Need to Know about Pair Programming I Learned In Kindergarten and what would make it better?**
   - I actually really enjoyed the paper. There were a lot of questions I asked on Perusall, and I am really interested to see what others have to say about them. For example, I noticed that the paper mentioned lots of psychological phenomena that I learned when I was studying for my MCAT, such as groupthink - the idea that just blindly agreeing with people just to keep harmony actually hinders performance - and social facilitation - the idea that, when we are around others, we tend to perform better on simple tasks. What can we learn from these theories, and how should we apply them to our industry? What are ways we can prevent groupthink, and based on social facilitation, should we stop the idea of 'working from home' and instead have our offices built into more public spaces to promote productivity and collaboration? I also thought it was interesting how the paper mentioned how people who are insecure with their skills should approach pair programming. I think that their statement was naive because people who are insecure about themselves are insecure because of reasons that have been conditioned into them over time. Instead of just stating how these people should approach pair programming, we should consider how to prevent this insecurity in the first place. What are some ways we can combat imposter syndrome in CS? Overall, I think the paper was concise and interesting. The only thing I think could make it better is adding more company quantitative data to back up the benefits of pair programming.  
2. **Did you get help or give help on Exercise #3: reduce()? If so, how?**
   - I got help from one of the TAs when solving reduce() because I didn't realize that we were to use the asterisks trick to slice the lists. At first, I was trying to make a helper method to solve the problem, but it's good to know how this useful tool can really simplify our code!
3. **What did you think of assignment, reduce(), and operators, and what would make it better?**
   - I liked the lectures that covered these topics, and learning about reduce() and operators was really cool. At first, I didn't understand why we were learning about reduce() in the first place - it seemed irrelevant and off-topic to me. Still, after doing the exercise, I realized how much it can simplify our code during development. I think that doing more practice with these topics, though, would be more helpful. Specifically, I think we should practice using these concepts in real-life situations that are more complex than simply implementing the reduce() function so we can understand why this material is useful and how it can be applied in a real-life context. 
4. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
   - My tip of the week is to take breaks and ask for help when you have bugs in your code. Last Friday, my startup, STEMkidz, had an outreach event in Sugarland. It was our first event of the year, and I was excited to finally be able to show parents what we do and spread the word about our initiative. Out of excitement that night, I decided to make some edits to our website so I could open up our teacher applications and camp registrations. I spent hours editing the frontend until it was as perfect and user-friendly as it could be. Tired and ready to finally enjoy my Friday night, I pushed my edits to Git Hub - and then, when I thought I was finally done, when I was ready to sit back and relax with my best friend, I get an email from Heroku - 'deployment failed'. My worst nightmare. It turned out that there was an issue with our website's pipeline since Heroku's stack and buildpacks had been deprecated. I was distraught and embarrassed to my core - what would parents think of us if they tried to visit the website and it was down? I stayed up until 3 am trying to fix the setup. It didn't help that I had no experience with dev-ops whatsoever. I was exhausted, frustrated, and helpless. It wasn't until the next day, when I asked my friend, who currently works in the industry, for help, that the website finally worked. Now, I realize that no matter how dedicated I am to fixing a problem, I need to learn to take a step back and ask for help instead of mindlessly trying to fix the solution - especially if it's a Friday night.
