1. **How well do you feel the course actually conveyed these ideas?
   (Feel free to share specific examples or moments when they “clicked” for you — or when they didn’t.)**
   - I think the course did a great job teaching the importance of testing, collaboration, and refactoring through
     the projects. The calculator project and parts of the website, for example, required heavy testing that sometimes
     felt unnecessary. However, writing those tests made me feel more confident in my code and my teammates' work and
     taught me that it's better to be safe than sorry when writing code. For the other concepts, although
     they were definitely mentioned in class, I had a hard time engaging with and understanding the material due to the
     class structure (learning through conversations with students). 
2. **Were there other lessons or habits you picked up that you think you’ll carry forward?**
   - Although this was not taught in class, I self-learned by building the website how to officially build both the frontend
     and backend from scratch. Before this class, I was only familiar with setting up the frontend. Now, I am much
     more confident in my ability to set up a full-stack application on my own.
3. **What tool, technique, or habit required for this course surprised you by becoming something you now find
   valuable? (Even if you hated it at first!)**
  - Writing the blogs at the end of every week taught me the importance of self-reflection. Although this assignment was
    and still feels tedious sometimes, it allowed me to take a few minutes out of my week to journal and reflect on my learning,
    which I think allowed me to better identify my weaknesses and understand how I learn best.
4. **Compared to your other CS classes at UT, how much did you grow in this course? (In skills, thinking, confidence —
    however you want to define “growth.”)**
  - I think I grew as a full-stack developer, but not so much as a coder. I think most of the core classes (data structures,
    computer architecture, and operating systems) were more comprehensive in that manner and are the classes in which I feel
    I grew the most as a person.
5. **Topic: CATME team formation**
  - I do not think that the CATME team formation was done well. It did not match me with a team that met my skills or availability,
    which was hard to work with and surprising. I wish we could choose our teams, since by this time in our college degree, we
    know who we work well with. One positive thing I learned from this experience was how to work with people with very
    different skill sets and people I am not normally comfortable around.
6. **Topic: cold calling**
  - I did not like how the class was taught through conversations initiated through cold calling. It was hard to stay engaged
    when classmates would answer questions in different ways or slower/faster than usual. I prefer a lecture format, where
    we can expect information to be consistently and clearly told to us. Although I liked how it motivated people to
    pay attention to the material, I feel like it reduced the 'fun' out of paying attention & learning the material well
    and instead instilled fear.
7. **Topic: ethics lectures**
  - I really loved the ethics lectures. I feel like this is a necessity for every degree plan, especially with computer
    science, given how technologies such as AI can easily be used for harm rather than good. The lecturers were engaging,
    and they gave us a very thorough understanding of ethics in CS that I know will prepare us to be better engineers.
8. **Topic: self-teaching many technologies**
  - I did not like how we had to self-learn so many technologies. I signed up for this class thinking that the bulk of the
    course would teach me about CSS frameworks, Typescript, React, mySQL, etc. It was disappointing that I had to spend
    many more hours on my own learning this when I could have done that without taking this class. Although it motivated
    me to learn it, I still am not sure whether it was worth taking a class for.
9. **Topic: underserved community requirement on IDB**
  - I liked how the website was geared towards helping an underserved community. It made us reflect on how we can use
    technology for greater good and also helped us learn more about inequalities in our communities and how to help solve them.
    The only thing I would improve on here would be to make the instructions more clear on what exactly constitutes an
    underserved community. Is the community restricted to a single city, or can it be nationwide?
