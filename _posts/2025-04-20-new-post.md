1. **What did you think of Paper 13. Misogyny and what would make it better?**
   - I really appreciated this paper. I think feminism and misogyny are misinterpreted and improperly implemented
     in society today. The paper explained really well that misogyny is a plague that affects all of us - all men,
     even those that seem loving, and women. I did notice that some of the comments left by classmates on the paper
     reflected a deeper misunderstanding of what causes misogyny, though. The paper does a good job hinting
     at the idea that women are treated differently not necessarily out of evil intentions, but mostly because
     society has been socialized in a way that undermines women in these fields, their competence, and
     their existence. Women have been socialized to be controlled. Men have not. Society has labeled professions,
     people, and looks by certain names. Women are often excluded out of that sphere when it comes to powerful STEM roles.
     If we want to change this, we need to change socialization and the way we raise our kids. That also means that feminism
     isn't necessarily about just uplifting women. It's about making equal rights between both men AND women.     
2. **Did you get help or give help on Exercise #14: Strategy1, Exercise #15: Strategy2, Exercise #16: Factory or the quizzes? If so, how?**
   - I did get help from my friend for Exercises 14 and 15. For example, in Exercise 14, I didn't realize that we needed
     to explicitly define constructors. I was absent for Exercise 16. 
3. **What did you think of the following topics, and what would make them better? Strategy design pattern, reflection, Factory Method design pattern, Abstract Factory design pattern**
  - I think the topics were taught well. I like how we are doing more exercises so we can learn these concepts in a more hands-on way.
    I am realizing, though, that I learn best when things are more explicitly shown to me, or if I read it in a textbook. So, learning
    by the conversations Professor Downing has with my classmates is really hard for me, and sometimes I miss the point of the conversation.
    I wish the structure of the class changed for this reason.
