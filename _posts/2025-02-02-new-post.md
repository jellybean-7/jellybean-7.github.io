1. **What did you think of Paper #3: Continuous Integration and what would make it better?**
   - I thought that the paper was really interesting and clarified what pipelines/CI are. Although we had to use a CI pipeline for our first project, I wasn't 100% sure what its purpose was, so it was nice to be able to read such a thorough, comprehensive article that discussed its purpose and benefits. However, to improve the paper, I would suggest making it shorter. The paper was really long, so it was hard to get through, and it also felt a bit repetitive. Instead, it would be nice if we discussed the details of CI during our lectures through an exercise/lesson. 
2. **Did you help your classmates with either the quizzes or Exercise #2: factorial()? If so, how?**
   - Yes. I helped my classmates determine the difference between is and == in Python. I specifically wrote that down in my notes during our lecture since I thought it was interesting how Java and Python differ in their usage of ==. I also helped my classmates on Exercise #2 when they were stuck on the factorial() implementation using a while loop by suggesting the use of a second variable to keep track of each multiplication. 
3. **What did you think of exceptions and reduce(), and what would make it better?**
   - I really liked the lecture that covered exceptions. I felt like it was very clear and well-organized, and it definitely made the quiz over exceptions very easy. However, I did feel like the lecture that covered reduce() was harder to understand. More specifically, when we were discussing some examples of reduce(), there was a reverse() function that used reduce() to reverse a list, but we didn't discuss it or its implementation. However, looking back, I feel like I didn't really understand that example very well. For the other parts of the lecture, I felt like it was a bit rushed since I was unfamiliar with this topic and had to go back to Lectures Online to rewatch the lecture more slowly. To make it better, I would suggest spending more time on reduce() and reinforcing through more examples. 
4. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
   - OpenAI just launched a new tool called 'deep research' to help researchers by performing web browsing/data analysis on the internet. As someone who is currently working on an honors thesis, I think this tool is extremely helpful and really simplifies the literature review/initial research required before delving into a research paper. I plan to give it a try this week!
