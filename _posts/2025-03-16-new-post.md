1. **What did you think of Paper 9. The Dependency Inversion Principle and what would make it better?**
   - I thought the paper was useful. I really liked how it specifically defined what a 'good design' is and thought
   that the material was extremely relevant, since programs with 'bad design' can be really deterimental to a company
   or organization. To make it better, I think it would be cool if the paper had case studies that studied how different
   organizations make their code's design 'good' and how that impacts the organization to prove its impact. 
2. **Did you get help or give help on Exercise #7: project, Exercise #8: cross_join, Exercise #9: natural_join_, or the quizzes? If so, how?**
   - I got help for all exercises, especially cross_join and natural_join_, since I felt like those were a bit harder than usual. 
   For example, for natural_join_, I initially implemented the class using a temporary list as my data structure. Then, a TA
   and Professor Downing both helped me realize how simplifying the code to a single line with a for loop is not only 
   cleaner, but also much more efficient. 
   - For the quizzes, I got help for the most recent one. On the last question, I almost selected (5, 0, 5) as an option
   until a classmate told me that it wouldn't make sense to have an output if you cross_join a relation with 0 rows - 
   especially since the total number of rows, mathematically, would be r*s = 5*0 = 0. 
3. **What did you think of the following topics, and what would make them better: relational algebra, project, cross_join, theta_join, natural_join**'
   - I thought the lecture covering relational algebra was a bit dry, since it was hard to really understand it without
   examples. However, I really liked project, cross_join, theta_join, and natural_join. I just wish that we learned this material
   earlier, since it would have been useful to use these in mySQL for our project. I also wish we learned these concepts
   not just by implementing them in Python, but also seeing how it works in mySQL.
