1. **What did you think of Paper 8. The Integration Segregation Principle and what would make it better?**
   - I thought that the paper was okay. I thought there were some cool things mentioned in the paper that
     I didn't know before, such as nil virtual functions. To make it better, as I said last blog, I wish there were more
     specific case studies/real-life examples that better illustrated the importance of implementing this principle. I also
     feel like the paper felt repetitive, and it's becoming a little difficult for me to distinguish between all the
     principles.  
2. **Did you get help or give help on Exercise #6: select or the quizzes? If so, how?**
   - I definitely got a lot of help on the exercise because it was hard for me to figure out how to get started. One of
     my classmates helped me realize that the function portion of select was actually much simpler than I had thought, with
     literally only three lines of code. For the class portion of select, the TA helped me structure my next function, and
     Professor Downing helped me understand why our solution worked - at first, we were confused how it could return a list
     of dictionaries if the next function stopped iterating right when it returned a dictionary, but Professor Downing
     reminded us that list() iterates as well and calls next multiple times. 
3. **What did you think of the following topics, and what would make them better: relational algebra, select**'
   - I thought that the discussion regarding relational algebra was interesting but had trouble engaging with the material
     for some reason this week. I feel like to make it better, it would be nice to first understand what SQL is. I also
     wish we discussed this more in advance, because I feel like for Phase Two, it's hard to understand how to create and use
     the SQL database without a foundational understanding of this material. 
4. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
   - My tip-of-the-week is to use Google Calendar to organize your time! I found that really useful this week when I was
     completely bombarded with work.
