Welcome to my page! I'm a third-year computer science & pre-medical student at UT-Austin, passionate about computers, medicine, entrepreneurship, and policy. In my free time, I love to work on my startup STEMkidz, go for long runs, paint, and play the violin. 

Here, I will be blogging for my Spring 2025 Software Engineering class at UT-Austin.

This page is a work in progress.
