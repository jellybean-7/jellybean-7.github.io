1. **What did you think of Paper 7. The Liskov Substitution Principle and what would make it better?**
   - I thought that the paper explained the Principle well! I liked how the Square-Rectangle problem and also thought it was
     cool that the paper mentioned a programming language called Eiffel that apparently has direct support for preconditions
     and post conditions. Would love to give it a try.

     To improve, I would suggest that the paper include more real-life, applicable examples than something as simple as the
     Square-Rectangle example. For instance, maybe an example of how inheritance helped a company transition and add a new
     feature would be useful. 
2. **Did you get help or give help on Exercise #5: cache or the quizzes? If so, how?**
   - I gave help for the Exercise, specifically when implementing the cache as a class, because it was a bit tricky to
     keep track of what variables were part of 'self' and which weren't. Once I got it working, I explained it to my friend
     and helped her pass all the tests as well. For the quizzes, I recieved a lot of help, since I thought they were pretty
     challenging. 
3. **What did you think of the following topics: =, *, and ** in functions, regular expressions, with, instance methods,
   static methods, class methods what would make them better?**'
   - I thought that the topics were explained well in class, but I had a hard time engaging with the material (except
     for the with & instance/static/class methods) because it was hard to understand why the information was important
     and relevant to software engineering. The with & instance/static/class methods was engaging since I had background
     knowledge on these topics already and know its importance in software development, but not so much with topics
     like regular expressions. As I mentioned in my previous blogs, I think it would really help if we could also cover
     why these topics are important and some real-life examples so we feel like engaging with the material. 
4. **What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
   - My tip-of-the-week is to start on the project due next week early since this seems to be a busy few weeks for all of us.
